## Features

<dl>
  <dt>React Project</dt>
  <dd>This project uses React 16.4 for the view part.</dd>

  <dt>Redux</dt>
  <dd>I've used Redux for maintaining state management of the project.</dd>

  <dt>JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use of combination of ES5 / template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS - Using Styled Components</dt>
  <dd>I've written composable CSS that's co-located with the components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Essentially we are shipping only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Code Quality (ESLint) / Prettier</dt>
  <dd>Like I've spoken in person. I've added code quality tools like ESlint, Prettier (for making it look prettier)</dd>

  <dt>Little bit SEO</dt>
  <dd>Added support for better SEO (Tag management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>

    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
4.  Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.
